# Express.js

* Express.js is a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js, helping to build web applications and APIs easily.  
* It simplifies the process of routing, handling HTTP requests, middleware management, and templating.  

```box
api => req,res
middleware => req,res,next 
        next => another middleware / endpoint
```
